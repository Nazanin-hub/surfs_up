# surfs_up
SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask

## Project Overview

W.Avy who is a famous investor helped me about investing on the surf and ice cream shop business. He asked me to prepare some information about temperature trends Specifically, temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Resources

Data Sources: hawaii.sqlite
Software: Python 3.7.7, Anaconda Navigator 1.9.12, Conda 4.8.4, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3

## Results

The belew tables show Summary statistics for June and December. The following results can be derived from the both tables:

 - The average tempreture in June is more than December. 
 - The standard deviation in December is higher than June. it means that the tempretures in December are more spread out from the mean.
 - 50% of tempretures in December are higher than 71 degree, while they are higher than 75 in June.
 - Tempretures are between 64 and 85 degree, while tempretures are between 56 and 83 in December.

## Summary


The below queries show the amount of precipitation for June and December.

     results_June = session.query(Measurement.date, Measurement.prcp).filter(extract('month', Measurement.date)==6).all()
     df = pd.DataFrame(precipitation_June, columns=['date','June Prcp'])
     df.describe()
     results_December = session.query(Measurement.date, Measurement.prcp).filter(extract('month', Measurement.date)==12).all()
     df = pd.DataFrame(precipitation_December, columns=['date','December Prcp'])
     df.describe()
     
The below tables are the result of the above queries:
